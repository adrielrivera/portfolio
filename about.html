            <div class="about-narrative">
                <p>As a Secondary 4 student at the School of Science and Technology, I have found myself constantly drawn to the world of cybersecurity. What began as a curiosity about how systems work has grown into a passion for digital defense and ethical hacking. I am excited by the prospect of channeling this passion into the Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics course at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, a programme that aligns perfectly with my interests and future goals.</p>
                
                <p>My journey has been marked by a commitment to hands-on learning and resilience. I have dedicated time to setting up my own penetration testing lab and teaching myself to use industry-standard tools like Burp Suite, Wireshark, and Kali Linux, often through self-study and late-night debugging sessions. These experiences have taught me to push through setbacks and stay adaptable â€“ traits I believe are crucial in the dynamic field of cybersecurity.</p>
                
                <p>Through a diploma in Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics, I hope to refine both my technical and investigative skills, collaborate with peers who share my passion, and prepare for a future career as a penetration tester. My aim is to help protect systems and people from evolving cyber threats, and I am confident that with my background, drive, and mindset, I can contribute meaningfully to this field.</p>
